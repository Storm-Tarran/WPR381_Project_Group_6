        <p class="team-card__bio">
          As our Team Lead & Backend Developer, Storm charts the project’s course and dives into the server-side code with equal 
          gusto. She mentors the crew, keeps everyone on track with clear goals, and engineers the APIs that power our portal’s 
          heartbeat. When she’s not coordinating sprints or optimizing database calls, you’ll find her championing collaboration 
          and turning complex problems into smooth, scalable solutions!

        <p class="team-card__bio">
          As our Backend & Frontend Developer, Rourke is the bridge between sleek user experiences and rock-solid server logic. 
          He crafts pixel-perfect interfaces in the browser by day and engineers efficient, scalable APIs by night—often in the 
          same coffee session! Whether it’s styling a button or optimizing a database query, Rourke keeps our whole stack running 
          smoothly and looking great.

          As our Document Manager, Don is the guardian of every file and form—organizing policies, procedures, and project plans 
          so nothing ever gets lost in the shuffle. He catalogs documents like a pro librarian, implements version control faster 
          than you can say “update,” and makes sure every team member always has the right paperwork at their fingertips. Off-duty, 
          he’s known to tame unruly filing cabinets and turn chaos into neatly archived order!

          As the team’s Data Manager, Johannes keeps our information orchestra in perfect harmony—collecting, cleaning, 
          and curating all the numbers so every project hits the right note. He builds rock-solid databases, whips unruly spreadsheets 
          into shape, and ensures everyone can instantly find the insights they need. When he’s not wrangling data, you’ll find him 
          turning raw figures into clear stories and maybe sneaking in a little data-driven magic!
